746465,“The Friar of Orders Gray” needlework picture,"Susanna Rowson’s Academy was one of the most important and well-known girl’s schools of the early nineteenth century. The needlework pictures made at her school are notable for their fine quality embroidery and for the wide range of design sources from literature and history used there. Mrs. Rowson believed in providing her students with prints that she could also use to teach lessons from. In this case, in 1806, in addition to completing the needlework picture depicting the poem ""The Friar of Orders Gray"", Narcissa Sewall (1791-1886) also wrote the entire poem, in impeccably beautiful handwriting, on the paper that backs the needlework’s frame. She was probably required to memorize and recite the poem as well. The poem is from a popular volume of poetry published in 1765 by Thomas Percy (1729-1811) called Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, which helped re-introduce the ballad verse form.Mrs. Rowson was an extraordinary woman even before she became a beloved teacher—born and raised in England, after her husband’s hardware business went bankrupt, the family went on stage, eventually traveling to Americaa to perform in Philadelphia, and then settling in Boston. Several of the plays she starred in were written by Mrs. Rowson herself. An accomplished writer, she penned many popular novels of the period, as well as poetry, songs, and text books after she became a school mistress.",[],1806,"Made in Newton, Massachusetts, United States","Silk on silk, paint",14 1/2 × 18 1/2 in.
